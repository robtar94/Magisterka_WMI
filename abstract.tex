\noindent Artificial neural networks are widely discussed in the scientific literature. The development of research in this field has opened up new possibilities for solving computational problems. With the help of neural networks, it is possible to model actions in a machine that until now were only possible for a human being.
This work is an interdisciplinary work combining music theory with computer science. Within it, I am dealing with the subject of understanding and creating music by a machine. The original system I propose was inspired by how the traditional models of neural networks operates. It is capable of both classifying musical pieces on its own and generating new ones, based on an existing example.
